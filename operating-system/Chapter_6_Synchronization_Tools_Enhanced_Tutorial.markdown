## 6.1 Background

**Detailed Explanation**:  
Concurrent execution enables multiple processes or threads to run simultaneously, leveraging multicore CPUs or multitasking systems. However, shared resources (e.g., memory, files, or devices) accessed concurrently can lead to **race conditions**, where the outcome depends on unpredictable execution timing, causing data corruption or errors. Synchronization tools (e.g., locks, semaphores) ensure processes coordinate access, preserving data integrity. Race conditions arise when operations are **non-atomic**, meaning they consist of multiple steps (e.g., read, modify, write) that can interleave. The OS must enforce **atomicity** or **serialization** to prevent such issues.

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Race Condition**:
```
[Thread 1]        [Thread 2]
   |                 |
Read counter (5)    Read counter (5)
   |                 |
Increment (6)       Increment (6)
   |                 |
Write counter (6)   Write counter (6)
   |                 |
Result: counter = 6 (Incorrect, should be 7)
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Bank Account Update**  
   - **Scenario**: Two bank clerks update a shared account balance of `$100`. Each adds `$50`, but without synchronization, the result is incorrect.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Clerk 1 reads balance (`$100`).  
     2. Clerk 2 reads balance (`$100`).  
     3. Clerk 1 writes `$150` (`100 + 50`).  
     4. Clerk 2 writes `$150` (`100 + 50`).  
     - **Result**: Balance is `$150` instead of `$200`.  
   - **Code (Unsynchronized)**:
     ```c
     balance = balance + 50; // Non-atomic: read, add, write
     ```
   - **Fix**: Use a lock to serialize access (see Section 6.5).

2. **Example 2: Online Voting System**  
   - **Scenario**: Two servers tally votes for a candidate (initially 10 votes). Each adds 1 vote, but a race condition occurs.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Server 1 reads votes (10).  
     2. Server 2 reads votes (10).  
     3. Server 1 writes 11.  
     4. Server 2 writes 11.  
     - **Result**: Votes = 11, not 12.  
   - **Code (Unsynchronized)**:
     ```c
     votes++; // Non-atomic
     ```
   - **Fix**: Use semaphores (Section 6.6).

3. **Example 3: Shared Printer Queue**  
   - **Scenario**: Two computers send print jobs to a shared printer queue. Without synchronization, jobs intermix.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Computer 1 adds job A.  
     2. Computer 2 adds job B before A completes.  
     3. Printer outputs mixed pages.  
     - **Result**: Corrupted output.  
   - **Code (Unsynchronized)**:
     ```c
     queue.add(job); // Non-atomic
     ```
   - **Fix**: Use a monitor (Section 6.7).

## 6.2 The Critical-Section Problem

**Detailed Explanation**:  
A **critical section** is a code segment accessing shared resources (e.g., variables, files), where only one process should execute at a time to avoid race conditions. The **critical-section problem** requires a protocol ensuring:
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process enters its critical section.  
- **Progress**: A process outside its critical section cannot block others.  
- **Bounded Waiting**: Waiting time is finite.  
A process’s code is structured as: **entry section** (requests access), **critical section** (accesses resource), **exit section** (releases access), and **remainder section** (other code). Solutions must be efficient, avoiding excessive CPU use or delays.

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Critical Section**:
```
[Process]
   |
Entry Section (Request access)
   |
Critical Section (Access shared resource)
   |
Exit Section (Release access)
   |
Remainder Section (Other tasks)
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Shared Database**  
   - **Scenario**: Two processes update a shared database table.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Process 1 requests entry.  
     2. Process 1 enters critical section, updates table.  
     3. Process 2 waits (entry section).  
     4. Process 1 exits, Process 2 enters.  
     - **Result**: Consistent updates.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     entry_section();
     update_table(); // Critical section
     exit_section();
     ```

2. **Example 2: Airport Runway**  
   - **Scenario**: Planes use a single runway, requiring exclusive access.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Plane 1 signals for takeoff (entry).  
     2. Plane 1 uses runway (critical section).  
     3. Plane 2 waits.  
     4. Plane 1 clears runway (exit), Plane 2 proceeds.  
     - **Result**: No collisions.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     request_runway();
     takeoff(); // Critical section
     release_runway();
     ```

3. **Example 3: Online Exam System**  
   - **Scenario**: Students submit answers to a shared server.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Student 1 requests access.  
     2. Student 1 submits answer (critical section).  
     3. Student 2 waits.  
     4. Student 1 completes, Student 2 submits.  
     - **Result**: No answer overwrites.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     lock_server();
     submit_answer(); // Critical section
     unlock_server();
     ```

**Figure Reference**: **Figure 6.1** shows a process with entry, critical, exit, and remainder sections.

## 6.3 Peterson’s Solution

**Detailed Explanation**:  
Peterson’s solution is a software-based algorithm for two processes to achieve mutual exclusion using shared variables: `turn` (whose turn to enter) and `interested` (array indicating intent). A process sets `interested[i] = true`, sets `turn = j` (yielding to the other), and waits if the other is interested and it’s not its turn. It satisfies mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting but assumes atomic load/store and is limited to two processes.

**Code (p. 263)**:
```c
boolean interested[2] = {false, false};
int turn;
do {
    interested[i] = true; // Process i wants to enter
    turn = j; // Yield to process j
    while (interested[j] && turn == j); // Wait if j is interested
    // Critical section
    interested[i] = false; // Exit
    // Remainder section
} while (true);
```

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Peterson’s Solution**:
```
[Process i]                    [Process j]
   |                              |
Set interested[i] = true        Set interested[j] = true
Set turn = j                    Set turn = i
   |                              |
Check (interested[j] && turn == j)  Check (interested[i] && turn == i)
   |                              |
Enter critical section (if clear)  Wait
   |                              |
Exit: interested[i] = false       Enter critical section
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Shared Printer**  
   - **Scenario**: Two computers share a printer.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Computer 1 sets `interested[1] = true`, `turn = 2`.  
     2. Computer 2 sets `interested[2] = true`, `turn = 1`.  
     3. Computer 1 waits (as `interested[2] = true`, `turn = 1`).  
     4. Computer 2 prints, sets `interested[2] = false`.  
     5. Computer 1 prints.  
     - **Result**: Sequential printing.  
   - **Code**: As above.

2. **Example 2: Traffic Intersection**  
   - **Scenario**: Two cars cross a single-lane bridge.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Car 1 signals intent, yields to Car 2.  
     2. Car 2 signals, waits as Car 1 has priority.  
     3. Car 1 crosses, clears intent.  
     4. Car 2 crosses.  
     - **Result**: Safe crossing.  
   - **Code**: Adapted Peterson’s algorithm.

3. **Example 3: Lab Equipment**  
   - **Scenario**: Two students share a microscope.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Student 1 sets intent, yields to Student 2.  
     2. Student 2 waits.  
     3. Student 1 uses microscope, clears intent.  
     4. Student 2 uses it.  
     - **Result**: Exclusive access.  
   - **Code**: As above.

## 6.4 Hardware Support for Synchronization

**Detailed Explanation**:  
Hardware provides **atomic instructions** to simplify synchronization, executing as uninterruptible units. Key instructions include:
- **Test-and-Set**: Sets a boolean lock to `true` and returns its previous value, enabling spinlocks.  
- **Compare-and-Swap (CAS)**: Compares a memory value to an expected value, updating it if they match, supporting lock-free structures.  
These instructions handle instruction reordering and are faster than software solutions, forming the basis for higher-level tools like mutexes.

**Code (Test-and-Set, p. 266)**:
```c
boolean test_and_set(boolean *target) {
    boolean rv = *target;
    *target = true;
    return rv;
}
do {
    while (test_and_set(&lock)); // Spin until lock is false
    // Critical section
    lock = false; // Release
} while (true);
```

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Test-and-Set**:
```
[Process]
   |
Call test_and_set(&lock)
   |-----------------|
   |                 |
Returns true      Returns false
   |                 |
Spin (wait)       Enter critical section
                     |
                  Set lock = false
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Vending Machine**  
   - **Scenario**: A vending machine dispenses one item at a time.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Customer 1 calls `test_and_set(&lock)`, gets `false`, enters.  
     2. Customer 2 calls `test_and_set(&lock)`, gets `true`, spins.  
     3. Customer 1 dispenses, sets `lock = false`.  
     4. Customer 2 dispenses.  
     - **Result**: One item per customer.  
   - **Code**: As above.

2. **Example 2: Game Server**  
   - **Scenario**: A server updates a player’s score.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Server 1 uses CAS to update score from 100 to 150.  
     2. Server 2 tries CAS, fails (value changed), retries.  
     3. Server 2 succeeds on retry.  
     - **Result**: Accurate score.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     while (compare_and_swap(&score, old, new) != old);
     ```

3. **Example 3: ATM Withdrawal**  
   - **Scenario**: Two ATMs access a shared account.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. ATM 1 uses `test_and_set`, withdraws $50.  
     2. ATM 2 spins until ATM 1 releases lock.  
     3. ATM 2 withdraws.  
     - **Result**: Correct balance.  
   - **Code**: As above.

## 6.5 Mutex Locks

**Detailed Explanation**:  
A **mutex lock** ensures mutual exclusion by requiring a process to acquire a lock (`acquire()`) before entering its critical section and release it (`release()`) after. If the lock is held, the process either **spins** (busy waiting, CPU-intensive) or **blocks** (sleeps, context-switch overhead). Mutexes are simpler than Peterson’s solution, widely used in OS kernels and applications, but spinlocks are inefficient for long waits.

**Code (p. 270)**:
```c
boolean available = true;
acquire() {
    while (!available) ; // Spin
    available = false;
}
release() {
    available = true;
}
```

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Mutex Lock**:
```
[Process]
   |
Call acquire()
   |-----------------|
   |                 |
Lock unavailable   Lock available
   |                 |
Spin              Set available = false
                     |
                  Critical section
                     |
                  Call release()
                     |
                  Set available = true
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Restroom Key**  
   - **Scenario**: A single restroom key ensures one user at a time.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. User 1 calls `acquire()`, gets key.  
     2. User 2 calls `acquire()`, waits.  
     3. User 1 calls `release()`, returns key.  
     4. User 2 uses restroom.  
     - **Result**: Exclusive access.  
   - **Code**: As above.

2. **Example 2: Online Store Inventory**  
   - **Scenario**: A store sells one item at a time.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Customer 1 locks inventory, buys item.  
     2. Customer 2 waits.  
     3. Customer 1 releases lock.  
     4. Customer 2 buys.  
     - **Result**: No overselling.  
   - **Code**: As above.

3. **Example 3: Lab Experiment**  
   - **Scenario**: A single centrifuge is shared by researchers.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Researcher 1 acquires lock, uses centrifuge.  
     2. Researcher 2 waits.  
     3. Researcher 1 releases lock.  
     4. Researcher 2 uses it.  
     - **Result**: Safe operation.  
   - **Code**: As above.

## 6.6 Semaphores

**Detailed Explanation**:  
A **semaphore** is an integer variable accessed via atomic operations: `wait()` (decrements, blocks if zero) and `signal()` (increments, unblocks waiters). Types include:
- **Binary Semaphore**: 0 or 1, like a mutex.  
- **Counting Semaphore**: Tracks multiple resources.  
Semaphores solve mutual exclusion, resource allocation, and ordering (e.g., producer-consumer). They’re versatile but require careful initialization to avoid deadlocks.

**Code (p. 273)**:
```c
wait(semaphore *S) {
    while (S->value <= 0) ; // Block
    S->value--;
}
signal(semaphore *S) {
    S->value++;
}
```

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Semaphore (Bounded-Buffer)**:
```
[Producer]                [Consumer]
   |                         |
wait(empty)               wait(full)
wait(mutex)               wait(mutex)
   |                         |
Add item                  Remove item
   |                         |
signal(mutex)             signal(mutex)
signal(full)              signal(empty)
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Parking Lot**  
   - **Scenario**: A lot has 5 spaces.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Car 1 calls `wait(spaces)`, parks (spaces = 4).  
     2. Car 6 calls `wait(spaces)`, blocks (spaces = 0).  
     3. Car 1 leaves, calls `signal(spaces)`.  
     4. Car 6 parks.  
     - **Result**: Controlled access.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     semaphore spaces = 5;
     wait(&spaces);
     park();
     signal(&spaces);
     ```

2. **Example 2: Coffee Shop Tray**  
   - **Scenario**: A tray holds 10 coffee cups.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Barista calls `wait(empty)`, adds cup.  
     2. Customer calls `wait(full)`, takes cup.  
     3. Barista blocks when tray is full.  
     4. Customer signals `empty`, barista adds cup.  
     - **Result**: Balanced production/consumption.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     semaphore full = 0, empty = 10, mutex = 1;
     // Producer
     wait(&empty); wait(&mutex);
     add_cup();
     signal(&mutex); signal(&full);
     ```

3. **Example 3: Exam Seats**  
   - **Scenario**: A room has 20 exam seats.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Student 1 takes seat (seats = 19).  
     2. Student 21 waits (seats = 0).  
     3. Student 1 leaves, signals seat.  
     4. Student 21 enters.  
     - **Result**: Fair access.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     semaphore seats = 20;
     wait(&seats);
     take_seat();
     signal(&seats);
     ```

## 6.7 Monitors

**Detailed Explanation**:  
A **monitor** is a high-level synchronization construct encapsulating shared data and procedures, ensuring only one process executes inside at a time. It uses **condition variables** (`wait()` to block, `signal()` to unblock) for processes waiting on specific conditions. Monitors simplify coding, reduce errors (compared to semaphores), and are supported in languages like Java. They’re ideal for complex problems like dining philosophers.

**Code (p. 277)**:
```c
monitor example {
    int resource;
    condition available;
    procedure use_resource() {
        if (resource == 0)
            wait(available);
        resource--;
        // Critical section
        signal(available);
    }
}
```

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Monitor**:
```
[Process]
   |
Enter monitor (auto-locked)
   |
Check condition
   |-----------------|
   |                 |
Condition false    Condition true
   |                 |
wait()            Critical section
   |                 |
signal()          Exit monitor
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Dining Philosophers**  
   - **Scenario**: Five philosophers share five chopsticks.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Philosopher 1 enters monitor, checks chopsticks.  
     2. If unavailable, waits on condition.  
     3. Grabs chopsticks, eats, releases.  
     4. Signals waiting philosopher.  
     - **Result**: No deadlock.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     monitor dining {
         condition chopsticks[5];
         take_chopsticks(i) {
             if (!available(i))
                 wait(chopsticks[i]);
             // Eat
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Example 2: Ride-Sharing App**  
   - **Scenario**: Matches drivers and riders.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Rider enters monitor, waits if no driver.  
     2. Driver enters, signals rider.  
     3. Pair matched, exits monitor.  
     4. Next rider/driver enters.  
     - **Result**: Efficient pairing.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     monitor rideshare {
         condition driver, rider;
         match() {
             if (no_driver)
                 wait(driver);
             signal(rider);
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Example 3: Hospital Triage**  
   - **Scenario**: Assigns patients to doctors.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Patient enters monitor, waits if no doctor.  
     2. Doctor signals availability.  
     3. Patient assigned, exits.  
     4. Next patient enters.  
     - **Result**: Organized assignments.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     monitor triage {
         condition doctor;
         assign() {
             if (no_doctor)
                 wait(doctor);
             // Assign
             signal(doctor);
         }
     }
     ```

## 6.8 Liveness

**Detailed Explanation**:  
**Liveness** ensures processes progress without indefinite delays. Key issues include:
- **Deadlock**: Processes wait forever for each other’s resources (e.g., two processes holding one resource each, waiting for the other).  
- **Starvation**: A process is perpetually denied resources due to unfair scheduling.  
Solutions include resource ordering, timeouts, or priority queues. Liveness is critical for system reliability and is revisited in Chapter 8 (Deadlocks).

**Visual Aid**:  
**Pseudo-Flowchart for Deadlock**:
```
[Process 1]            [Process 2]
   |                     |
Hold resource A        Hold resource B
   |                     |
Wait for B             Wait for A
   |                     |
Deadlock               Deadlock
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: File Access**  
   - **Scenario**: Two processes need two files.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Process 1 locks File A, waits for File B.  
     2. Process 2 locks File B, waits for File A.  
     3. Deadlock occurs.  
     4. Timeout releases one lock.  
     - **Result**: Resolved with timeout.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     lock(fileA);
     while (!try_lock(fileB)) wait();
     ```

2. **Example 2: Traffic Lights**  
   - **Scenario**: Cars at a four-way intersection.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. North car waits for east clearance.  
     2. East car waits for north.  
     3. Starvation if one direction is favored.  
     4. Timer cycles directions.

3. **Example 3: Print Queue**  
   - **Scenario**: Jobs wait for a printer.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Large job monopolizes printer.  
     2. Small jobs starve.  
     3. Priority queue ensures fairness.  
     4. All jobs print.

## 6.9 Evaluation

**Detailed Explanation**:  
Synchronization tools are evaluated on:
- **Usability**: Ease of implementation (monitors > semaphores > locks).  
- **Performance**: Overhead (spinlocks for short waits, blocking for long waits).  
- **Problem Avoidance**: Preventing deadlock, starvation, or complexity.  
Spinlocks are fast but CPU-intensive; semaphores are versatile but error-prone; monitors are structured but language-dependent; lock-free algorithms (CAS) minimize contention but are complex.

**Visual Aid**:  
**Comparison Table**:
```
| Tool       | Usability | Performance | Problem Avoidance |
|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Spinlock   | Moderate  | High (short)| Deadlock risk     |
| Semaphore  | Moderate  | Moderate    | Error-prone       |
| Monitor    | High      | Moderate    | Structured        |
| Lock-Free  | Low       | High        | Complex           |
```

**Examples**:
1. **Example 1: Real-Time Game**  
   - **Scenario**: Updates player positions.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Spinlocks used for quick updates.  
     2. Low overhead, high performance.  
     3. Risk of deadlock if held long.  
     4. Short critical sections chosen.  
     - **Result**: Fast updates.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     while (test_and_set(&lock));
     update_position();
     lock = false;
     ```

2. **Example 2: Database Transactions**  
   - **Scenario**: Manages complex queries.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Monitors encapsulate queries.  
     2. Condition variables handle waits.  
     3. Structured, low error rate.  
     4. Higher overhead than spinlocks.  
     - **Result**: Reliable transactions.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     monitor database {
         query() { /* Use condition */ }
     }
     ```

3. **Example 3: IoT Devices**  
   - **Scenario**: Sensors update a server.  
   - **Flow**:  
     1. Lock-free CAS updates data.  
     2. Avoids contention on multicore.  
     3. Complex to implement.  
     4. High performance achieved.  
     - **Result**: Scalable updates.  
   - **Code**:
     ```c
     while (compare_and_swap(&data, old, new) != old);
     ```

## Solved Practice Exercises (p. 287–288)

**Exercise 6.1**: What is the purpose of the `test_and_set()` instruction?  
**Solution**: The `test_and_set()` instruction atomically sets a boolean lock to `true` and returns its prior value, enabling mutual exclusion via spinlocks. It ensures only one process enters a critical section, critical for high-performance systems like vending machines dispensing one item at a time.  
**Code**:
```c
boolean test_and_set(boolean *target) {
    boolean rv = *target;
    *target = true;
    return rv;
}
```

**Exercise 6.4**: Show that Peterson’s solution satisfies mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.  
**Solution**:  
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process enters, as `interested[i] = true` and `turn = j` block the other if both are interested.  
- **Progress**: If one process is not interested, the other enters immediately.  
- **Bounded Waiting**: A process waits only while the other is in its critical section, with `turn` ensuring alternation.  
**Example**: Two cars at a bridge use Peterson’s algorithm, ensuring one crosses at a time with finite waiting.  
**Code**: See Section 6.3.

**Exercise 6.7**: Describe how semaphores can be used to solve the bounded-buffer problem.  
**Solution**: Use three semaphores: `mutex` (binary, mutual exclusion), `full` (counting, full slots), `empty` (counting, empty slots).  
- **Producer**: `wait(empty)` checks space, `wait(mutex)` locks buffer, adds item, `signal(mutex)`, `signal(full)`.  
- **Consumer**: `wait(full)` checks items, `wait(mutex)` locks, removes item, `signal(mutex)`, `signal(empty)`.  
**Example**: A coffee shop’s 10-cup tray uses semaphores to balance barista production and customer consumption.  
**Code**:
```c
semaphore mutex = 1, full = 0, empty = N;
producer() {
    wait(&empty); wait(&mutex); add_item();
    signal(&mutex); signal(&full);
}
consumer() {
    wait(&full); wait(&mutex); remove_item();
    signal(&mutex); signal(&empty);
}
```

## Important Practices

- **Critical-Section Protocols**: Design solutions ensuring mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting.  
- **Semaphore Management**: Initialize correctly and position `wait()`/`signal()` to avoid deadlocks.  
- **Monitor Implementation**: Use monitors for structured synchronization, leveraging condition variables.  
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Apply test-and-set/CAS for low-level, high-performance locks.  
- **Liveness Strategies**: Prevent deadlock (resource ordering) and starvation (fair scheduling).  
- **Problem Mastery**: Solve bounded-buffer, dining philosophers, and similar problems with multiple tools.  
- **Visual Learning**: Use flowcharts and figures to internalize concepts.
